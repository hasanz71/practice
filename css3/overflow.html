        Etymology There are two theories regarding the naming of Kanaighat. The
        word ghat in the Bengali language refers to a flight of steps leading
        down to a river. The Kanaighat Bazar, which the Kanaighat Upazila is
        named after, sits on the banks of the Surma River. The most popular
        theory is that there was a boatman (majhi) by the name of Kanai who
        lived here. Others suggest that it was named after Kanai Chowdhury of
        Mulagul
